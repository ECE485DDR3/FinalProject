Just wanted to share this file with you guys.

Adrian, can you take a look at this code. I find it easier to work with then C. 
Two files.
1) ParseCpuRequests.rb does three things
reads external final into array
parses each instruction into row,bank,col,instruction,cpu time
simulates the memory controller where 
buffer can only take 16 instructions at a time and all instructions take 200 cpu cycles for now. 
it displays current cpu cycle count, buffer size, last entry to the buffer, and DRAM cycle count

So how can you run this tho. 
well it's pretty simple actually. 

you can set up your environment here. btw, macs already come with Ruby installed i believe.
http://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/ruby_environment.htm

after setting up the environment, to run my file, in your terminal go to the home directory of the where you copy them to and type :

>ruby ParseCpuRequests.rb

done!!

Let me know what you guys think. I would really like it if we can work with something like ruby or python or java. 
faust said it would be fine as well.
