Just wanted to share this file with you guys.

Adrian, can you take a look at this code. I find it easier to work with then C. 
Two files.
1) ParseCpuRequests.rb does three things
reads external final into array
parses each instruction into row,bank,col,instruction,cpu time
simulates the memory controller where 
buffer can only take 16 instructions at a time and all instructions take 200 cpu cycles for now. 
it displays current cpu cycle count, buffer size, last entry to the buffer, and DRAM cycle count

you can set up your environment here. btw, macs already come with Ruby installed i believe.
http://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/ruby_environment.htm

after setting up the environment in your terminal go to the home dir of the where you copy them type:
>ruby ParseCpuRequests.rb

to get ruby to output to a text file since there is so much data
>ruby ParseCpuRequests.rb > output.txt

current syntax is 
>ruby ParseCpuRequests.rb testcase0.txt
