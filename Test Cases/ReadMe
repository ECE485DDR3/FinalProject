  case, the simulation would end prematurely

- test skipping forward if queue empty
- should skip ahead to CPU clock 1000 at begining of the program
- should skip ahead to CPU clock 10000 after finished with first request at 1056 (tRCD * 4 + 1000)
- should skip ahead to CPU clock 10150 after finished with second request at 10056
  but not issue the dram command until 10200
