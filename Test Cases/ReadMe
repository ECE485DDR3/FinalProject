Note errors display on terminal

tescase0 - Pass
- original input file from proj description

testcase6 - Pass
- 3 commands, the last request is added to the queue after the queue has emptied
- This testcase addresses the bug where the queue has been emptied, and end of file
  has been reached, but there is stil an item in the fileRequest variable, in this
  case, the simulation would end prematurely

testcase11 - Pass
- test skipping forward if queue empty
- should skip ahead to CPU clock 1000 at begining of the program
- should skip ahead to CPU clock 10000 after finished with first request at 1056 (tRCD * 4 + 1000)
- should skip ahead to CPU clock 10150 after finished with second request at 10056
  but not issue the dram command until 10200
  
testcaseIn.txt - Pass
line 1 correct
line 2 cpu clock goes backwards in time 
line 3 address too big
line 4 address too small
line 5 address cpu clock non-integer number
line 6 address '0x' is in wrong position
line 7 address contains non-hex numbers 
line 8 Bad instruction name
line 9 address missing 
line 10 blank space
line 11 cpu time very large

testcase1 - Only Read/IFETCH commands
- 2 diff columns + sequential bytes
- expect 16 clock seperation (4 clk * 4dram/1clk)

test1 -Random Commands
- Same Row - Different col+byte+Bank

test2 -Random Commands - Long TIME=4000
- Same bank+col - Different byte+row

test3 -Random Commands
- Same bank+row - Different byte+col

test4 -Random Commands
- Same col+row - Different byte+bank

test5 -Random Commands
- Same col+row+bank - Different byte

test6 -Random Commands - Long TIME=4000
- Same bank - Different row+col+byte

test7 -Random Commands
- Differen col+byte+Row+Bank

testFutureConflict
- read followed by read to same bank but different row followed by several writes to a different bank all same row
- make sure the writes dont interfere with the time the second read should be issued
